# CDX

cdx is a simple bat script to help you cd faster. When directories have long names it becomes tedious to type them out and slows us down. cdx script allows you to type any substring of the directory name you want to cd into and it will find the matching directory and cd into it. If there are multiple directories that have a substring you provided then it will cd into the first one that matches.

### Installation

Download the bat script from the repo. Put it in some path and add the path to the `PATH` environment variable.

### Usage

```bash
call cdx <dir_name_substring>
```
